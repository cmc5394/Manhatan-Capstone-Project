In Manhattan, New York, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it?

Manhattan is a very populated city, that already has many venues and places for entertainment. That is why we want to open a coffee shop in a crowded spot, but with not that much competition. Not more than 2 coffee shops in the same apple, but it can have other type of restaurants arround, actually it could be helpful to attract more clients.
